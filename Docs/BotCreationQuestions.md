# Bot Creation Questions

**Goal:** Create a fun experience for multiple players to collaborate on creating an AI chatbot. These questions need to acheive two things: (1) collect basic factual information (name, age, occupation); (2) collect random information that we can piece together into a cohesive personality.

## Instructions
You can create bots to fill your world to make it more interesting. You can stick to a theme, or mix and match characters. Feel free to give your bot the persona of a character from popular culture; in fact, that might give you a more interesting character. Answer these questions from the perspective of your bot.
