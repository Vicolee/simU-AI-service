# Sign Up Questions

Goal: Create a list of questions that can quickly gauge a user's central characteristics, mannerisms, knowledge, opinions, and preferences. Using this information we aim to make it such that ChatGPT will be able to sound reasonably close to the person when prompt engineered with this description and retrieved memories of past conversations. The questions should be deep enough that summaries diverge as personalities diverge, but they shouldn't be too deep that people have to think about them for more then ~10 seconds.

## Example Persona Summary
"I'm Alex, a software developer with a passion for environmental sustainability. I tend to be optimistic and use humor often, even in serious discussions. I believe strongly in the importance of renewable energy and reducing waste. When discussing tech, I'm detailed and analytical, but I always try to simplify complex ideas for better understanding. I frequently use phrases like 'On the bright side...' and 'Let's break it down...'. If asked about a new tech gadget, I'd be skeptical about its eco-friendliness before considering its utility."
